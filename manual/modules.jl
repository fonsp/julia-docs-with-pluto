Modules in Julia help organize code into coherent units. They are delimited syntactically inside `module NameOfModule ... end`, and have the following features:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d05b2c-9e19-11eb-0a67-838433489224
md"""
1. Modules are separate namespaces, each introducing a new global scope. This is useful, because it allows the same name to be used for different functions or global variables without conflict, as long as they are in separate modules.
2. Modules have facilities for detailed namespace management: each defines a set of names it `export`s, and can import names from other modules with `using` and `import` (we explain these below).
3. Modules can be precompiled for faster loading, and contain code for runtime initialization.
"""

Typically, in larger Julia packages you will see module code organized into files, eg

md"""
Files and file names are mostly unrelated to modules; modules are associated only with module expressions. One can have multiple files per module, and multiple modules per file. `include` behaves as if the contents of the source file were evaluated in its place. In this chapter, we use short and simplified examples, so we won't use `include`.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d05bae-9e19-11eb-31ed-1f2cf37beafe
md"""
The recommended style is not to indent the body of the module, since that would typically lead to whole files being indented. Also, it is common to use `UpperCamelCase` for module names (just like types), and use the plural form if applicable, especially if the module contains a similarly named identifier, to avoid name clashes. For example,

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d05c80-9e19-11eb-3807-a946cbb83ac2
md"""
Names for functions, variables and types in the global scope like `sin`, `ARGS`, and `UnitRange` always belong to a module, called the *parent module*, which can be found interactively with [`parentmodule`](@ref), for example

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d05e2e-9e19-11eb-01bd-d1bd554713c0
md"""
One can also refer to these names outside their parent module by prefixing them with their module, eg `Base.UnitRange`. This is called a *qualified name*. The parent module may be accessible using a chain of submodules like `Base.Math.sin`, where `Base.Math` is called the *module path*. Due to syntactic ambiguities, qualifying a name that contains only symbols, such as an operator, requires inserting a colon, e.g. `Base.:+`. A small number of operators additionally require parentheses, e.g. `Base.:(==)`.
"""

md"""
Within a module, a variable name can be ‚Äúreserved‚Äù without assigning to it by declaring it as `global x`. This prevents name conflicts for globals initialized after load time. The syntax `M.x = y` does not work to assign a global in another module; global assignment is always module-local.

md"""
It is common to export names which form part of the API (application programming interface). In the above code, the export list suggests that users should use `nice` and `DOG`. However, since qualified names always make identifiers accessible, this is just an option for organizing APIs: unlike other languages, Julia has no facilities for truly hiding module internals.
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d05ef8-9e19-11eb-0483-a78043107b10

Also, some modules don't export names at all. This is usually done if they use common words, such as `derivative`, in their API, which could easily clash with the export lists of other modules. We will see how to manage name clashes below.

"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d05faa-9e19-11eb-2a82-7fed748581fc
md"""
Technically, the statement `using ModuleName` means that a module called `ModuleName` will be available for resolving names as needed. When a global variable is encountered that has no definition in the current module, the system will search for it among variables exported by `ModuleName` and use it if it is found there. This means that all uses of that global within the current module will resolve to the definition of that variable in `ModuleName`.

An identifier brought into scope by `import` or `using` can be renamed with the keyword `as`. This is useful for working around name conflicts as well as for shortening names. For example, `Base` exports the function name `read`, but the CSV.jl package also provides `CSV.read`. If we are going to invoke CSV reading many times, it would be convenient to drop the `CSV.` qualifier. But then it is ambiguous whether we are referring to `Base.read` or `CSV.read`:

Here, Julia cannot decide which `f` you are referring to, so you have to make a choice. The following solutions are commonly used:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d064b4-9e19-11eb-10c5-8584faf80e93
md"""
1. Simply proceed with qualified names like `A.f` and `B.f`. This makes the context clear to the reader of your code, especially if `f` just happens to coincide but has different meaning in various packages. For example, `degree` has various uses in mathematics, the natural sciences, and in everyday life, and these meanings should be kept separate.
2. Use the `as` keyword above to rename one or both identifiers, eg

    ```julia
    using A: f as f
    using B: f as g
    ```

    would make `B.f` available as `g`. Here, we are assuming that you did not use `using A` before, which would have brought `f` into the namespace.
3. When the names in question *do* share a meaning, it is common for one module to import it from another, or have a lightweight ‚Äúbase‚Äù package with the sole function of defining an interface like this, which can be used by other packages. It is conventional to have such package names end in `...Base` (which has nothing to do with Julia's `Base` module).

The incremental precompiled module file are created and used automatically when using `import` or `using` to load a module.

The resulting cache files will be stored in `DEPOT_PATH[1]/compiled/`. Subsequently, the module is automatically recompiled upon `using` or `import` whenever any of its dependencies change; dependencies are modules it imports, the Julia build, files it includes, or explicit dependencies declared by [`include_dependency(path)`](@ref) in the module file(s).

It also takes into account whether the path to the file chosen by the search logic in `require` matches the path that had created the precompile file. It also takes into account the set of dependencies already loaded into the current process and won't recompile those modules, even if their files change or disappear, in order to avoid creating incompatibilities between the running system and the precompile cache.

If you know that a module is *not* safe to precompile your module (for example, for one of the reasons described below), you should put `__precompile__(false)` in the module file (typically placed at the top). This will cause `Base.compilecache` to throw an error, and will cause `using` / `import` to load it directly into the current process and skip the precompile and caching. This also thereby prevents the module from being imported by any other precompiled module.

You may need to be aware of certain behaviors inherent in the creation of incremental shared libraries which may require care when writing your module. For example, external state is not preserved. To accommodate this, explicitly separate any initialization steps that must occur at *runtime* from steps that can occur at *compile time*. For this purpose, Julia allows you to define an `__init__()` function in your module that executes any initialization steps that must occur at runtime. This function will not be called during compilation (`--output-*`). Effectively, you can assume it will be run exactly once in the lifetime of the code. You may, of course, call it manually if necessary, but the default is to assume this function deals with computing state for the local machine, which does not need to be ‚Äì or even should not be ‚Äì captured in the compiled image. It will be called after the module is loaded into a process, including if it is being loaded into an incremental compile (`--output-incremental=yes`), but not if it is being loaded into a full-compilation process.

In particular, if you define a `function __init__()` in a module, then Julia will call `__init__()` immediately *after* the module is loaded (e.g., by `import`, `using`, or `require`) at runtime for the *first* time (i.e., `__init__` is only called once, and only after all statements in the module have been executed). Because it is called after the module is fully imported, any submodules or other imported modules have their `__init__` functions called *before* the `__init__` of the enclosing module.

Two typical uses of `__init__` are calling runtime initialization functions of external C libraries and initializing global constants that involve pointers returned by external libraries.  For example, suppose that we are calling a C library `libfoo` that requires us to call a `foo_init()` initialization function at runtime. Suppose that we also want to define a global constant `foo_data_ptr` that holds the return value of a `void *foo_data()` function defined by `libfoo` ‚Äì this constant must be initialized at runtime (not at compile time) because the pointer address will change from run to run.  You could accomplish this by defining the following `__init__` function in your module:

Notice that it is perfectly possible to define a global inside a function like `__init__`; this is one of the advantages of using a dynamic language. But by making it a constant at global scope, we can ensure that the type is known to the compiler and allow it to generate better optimized code. Obviously, any other globals in your module that depends on `foo_data_ptr` would also have to be initialized in `__init__`.

Constants involving most Julia objects that are not produced by [`ccall`](@ref) do not need to be placed in `__init__`: their definitions can be precompiled and loaded from the cached module image. This includes complicated heap-allocated objects like arrays. However, any routine that returns a raw pointer value must be called at runtime for precompilation to work ([`Ptr`](@ref) objects will turn into null pointers unless they are hidden inside an [`isbits`](@ref) object). This includes the return values of the Julia functions [`@cfunction`](@ref) and [`pointer`](@ref).

Dictionary and set types, or in general anything that depends on the output of a `hash(key)` method, are a trickier case.  In the common case where the keys are numbers, strings, symbols, ranges, `Expr`, or compositions of these types (via arrays, tuples, sets, pairs, etc.) they are safe to precompile.  However, for a few other key types, such as `Function` or `DataType` and generic user-defined types where you haven't defined a `hash` method, the fallback `hash` method depends on the memory address of the object (via its `objectid`) and hence may change from run to run. If you have one of these key types, or if you aren't sure, to be safe you can initialize this dictionary from within your `__init__` function. Alternatively, you can use the [`IdDict`](@ref) dictionary type, which is specially handled by precompilation so that it is safe to initialize at compile-time.

When using precompilation, it is important to keep a clear sense of the distinction between the compilation phase and the execution phase. In this mode, it will often be much more clearly apparent that Julia is a compiler which allows execution of arbitrary Julia code, not a standalone interpreter that also generates compiled code.

1. Global counters (for example, for attempting to uniquely identify objects). Consider the following code snippet:

    ```julia
    mutable struct UniquedById
        myid::Int
        let counter = 0
            UniquedById() = new(counter += 1)
        end
    end
    ```

    while the intent of this code was to give every instance a unique id, the counter value is recorded at the end of compilation. All subsequent usages of this incrementally compiled module will start from that same counter value.

    Note that `objectid` (which works by hashing the memory pointer) has similar issues (see notes on `Dict` usage below).

    One alternative is to use a macro to capture [`@__MODULE__`](@ref) and store it alone with the current `counter` value, however, it may be better to redesign the code to not depend on this global state.
2. Associative collections (such as `Dict` and `Set`) need to be re-hashed in `__init__`. (In the future, a mechanism may be provided to register an initializer function.)
3. Depending on compile-time side-effects persisting through load-time. Example include: modifying arrays or other variables in other Julia modules; maintaining handles to open files or devices; storing pointers to other system resources (including memory);
4. Creating accidental "copies" of global state from another module, by referencing it directly instead of via its lookup path. For example, (in global scope):

    ```julia
    #mystdout = Base.stdout #= will not work correctly, since this will copy Base.stdout into this module =#
    # instead use accessor functions:
    getstdout() = Base.stdout #= best option =#
    # or move the assignment into the runtime:
    __init__() = global mystdout = Base.stdout #= also works =#

A few other points to be aware of:
"""

# ‚ïî‚ïê‚ï° 03d07170-9e19-11eb-0df3-73a1785ddd49
md"""
1. No code reload / cache invalidation is performed after changes are made to the source files themselves, (including by `Pkg.update`), and no cleanup is done after `Pkg.rm`
2. The memory sharing behavior of a reshaped array is disregarded by precompilation (each view gets its own copy)
3. Expecting the filesystem to be unchanged between compile-time and runtime e.g. [`@__FILE__`](@ref)/`source_path()` to find resources at runtime, or the BinDeps `@checked_lib` macro. Sometimes this is unavoidable. However, when possible, it can be good practice to copy resources into the module at compile-time so they won't need to be found at runtime.
4. `WeakRef` objects and finalizers are not currently handled properly by the serializer (this will be fixed in an upcoming release).
5. It is usually best to avoid capturing references to instances of internal metadata objects such as `Method`, `MethodInstance`, `MethodTable`, `TypeMapLevel`, `TypeMapEntry` and fields of those objects, as this can confuse the serializer and may not lead to the outcome you desire. It is not necessarily an error to do this, but you simply need to be prepared that the system will try to copy some of these and to create a single unique instance of others.

It is sometimes helpful during module development to turn off incremental precompilation. The command line flag `--compiled-modules={yes|no}` enables you to toggle module precompilation on and off. When Julia is started with `--compiled-modules=no` the serialized modules in the compile cache are ignored when loading modules and module dependencies. `Base.compilecache` can still be called manually. The state of this command line flag is passed to `Pkg.build` to disable automatic precompilation triggering when installing, updating, and explicitly building packages.
